# Users and Groups

**Linux (and Unix) is a multi-user system**. This means that multiple users can access system and hardware resources like applications, file systems, cpu processing, networking, ... at the same time. Is has been developed as such from the beginning.

In order for this multi-user design to work properly, there needs to be decent user and group management available. An administrator needs to be able to restrict access to certain resources, protect users from one another, add users, delete users and so on.

User groups also play an important role on Linux systems. They provide an easy way of managing access and permissions to resources such as files. They also allow sysadmins to more effectively manage user privileges, since they can assign privileges to groups rather than individual users.

## Linux Users

In Linux, there are two types of users: **system users** and **regular users**. Traditionally, system users are used to run non-interactive or background processes on a system, while regular users are used for logging in and running processes interactively.

An easy way to view all of the users on a system is to look at the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file. Each line in this file contains information about a single user.

Output the `passwd` file content with the `cat` command:

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ cat /etc/passwd
```

Rendering an output equivalent to:

::: output
<pre>
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
...
gdm:x:125:130:Gnome Display Manager:/var/lib/gdm3:/bin/false
bioboost:x:1000:1000:Nico De Witte,,,:/home/bioboost:/usr/bin/bash
</pre>
:::

The `/etc/passwd` contains one entry per line for each user (user account) of the system. All fields are separated by a colon `:` symbol. It houses a total of seven fields for each user. Generally, an `/etc/passwd` entry consists of the following fields:

![passwd entries](./img/passwd_entries.png)

* **Username**: this is the actual login of the user.
* **Password**: an `x` character indicates that password is stored as a hashed string in the `/etc/shadow` file. An exclamation mark `!` here indicates a locked account.
* **User ID (UID)**: Although, most commands will usually show the user owner as a name, the operating system is actually associating the user ownership with the `UID` (user id) for that user name. Each user must be assigned a user ID. UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID 100-999 are reserved by the system for administrative and system accounts.
* **Group ID (GID)**: The Group ID (GID) of the primary group of this user.
* **User ID Info**: This is the comment field. It contains the optional extra information about users such as their full name, location, phone number, ...
* **Home directory**: The absolute path to the home directory of user. This is also the default directory a user will be directed too once he/she logged in to the system.
* **Command / shell**: The absolute path to the user shell or command to execute on login. On most debian systems this will default to `/bin/bash`.

::: warning `/usr/sbin/nologin`
Some entries show `/usr/sbin/nologin` as a shell. This is actually not a shell but a command that displays a message that an account is not available after which is closes the connection. It is intended as a replacement shell field for accounts that have been disabled.

Do note that this on its own does not disable/lock the account. It only displays a message on a login attempt. Non-interactive logins are still available if no measures are taken to prevent this too. More on this topic later.
:::

### Super user

In addition to the two user types, there is the **root user** (also called the *superuser*), who has the ability to override any file ownership and permission restrictions. In practice, this means that the superuser has the rights to access anything on his/her own server. This user is used to make system-wide changes, and must be kept secure.

Opening a shell prompt as the superuser can be achieved by executing the command `su` (substitute user), after which you are required to provide the password of the root user. Once logged in as the root user, notice how the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.

Be careful because the root user has the **ability to do anything on the system**. When executing commands as the root user there are some disadvantages that need to be kept in mind:

* no record of system altering commands
* no record of the user that performed the system altering commands
* no access to your user shell environment (that is the environment variables from the user as which you were originally logged in)
* you have to enter the root password, meaning that everyone that requires this type of access, needs to know the password.

It is also possible to configure other user accounts with the ability to assume "superuser rights". Using the `sudo` prefix before the command, the user stays logged in with his/her own user account, but can apply system wide changes. In fact, creating a normal user that has `sudo` (superuser do) privileges for system administration tasks is considered to be best practice, as it counters the previously mentioned disadvantages of switching to the superuser account.

Take for example the action to view the `/etc/shadow` file. Trying this with a normal user accounts gives you a permission denied error.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ cat /etc/shadow
```

::: output
<pre>
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
</pre>
:::

By prefixing the command with `sudo`, we indicate that we want to execute the command with elevated administrator privileges (of course if the account is permitted to do so). Note that one will need to provide its user password before this will work.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo cat /etc/shadow
```

::: output
<pre>
root:!:18786:0:99999:7:::
...
bioboost:**********:18786:0:99999:7:::
</pre>
:::

Basically, the `/etc/shadow` file stores secure user account information. All fields are separated by a colon `:`. It contains one entry per line for each user listed in the `/etc/passwd` file. The fields are as follows:

**Username**: The loginname of the user
**Password**: The hashed password (often called encrypted but those days are luckily way behind us). Usually password format is set to `$id$salt$hashed` where `$id` indicates the algorithm that was used (MD5, Blowfish, SHA-256, SHA-512, ...). If the password field contains an asterisk `*` or exclamation mark `!`, the user will not be able to login to the system using password authentication. Other login methods like key-based authentication or switching to the user are still allowed.
* **Last password change**: This is the date when the password was last changed. The number of days is counted since January 1, 1970 (epoch date).
* **Minimum password age**: The number of days that must pass before the user password can be changed. Typically it is set to zero, which means that there is no minimum password age.
* **Maximum password age**: The number of days after the user password must be changed. By default, this number is set to 99999.
* **Warning period**: The number of days before the password expires during which the user is warned that the password must be changed.
* **Inactivity period**: The number of days after the user password expires before the user account is disabled. Typically this field is empty.
* **Expiration date**. The date when the account was disabled. It is represented as an epoch date.

The `/etc/shadow` file should not be edited by hand unless you know what you are doing. Always use a command that is designed for the purpose. For example, to change a user password, use the `passwd` command, and to change the password aging information, use the `chage` command.

::: warning Switching to root with sudo
Note that in many cases the super user account is disabled for login. In this case, a regular user with `sudo` rights can still switch to the root user using the `sudo su` command. The password that is required in this case is not that of the `root` user, but that of the current user. If the root user is disabled, one cannot directly login via a login prompt as the root user.
:::

## Linux Groups

Groups are collections of zero or more users. A user belongs to a default group (primary group), and can also be a member of any of the other groups on a server (secondary groups).

Groups make it easy to manage users with the same security and access privileges. They also allow the administrator to logically categorize users on the system.

An easy way to view all the groups is to look in the `/etc/group` file.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ cat /etc/group
```

Which should output something like:

::: output
<pre>
root:x:0:
daemon:x:1:
bin:x:2:
sys:x:3:
adm:x:4:syslog,bioboost
...
dialout:x:20:bioboost
...
sudo:x:27:bioboost
...
bioboost:x:1000:
...
docker:x:998:bioboost
...
</pre>
:::

The fields of each entry are as follows:

* **Group name**: the textual name of the group.
* **password**: the (encrypted/hashed) group password. If this field is empty, no password is needed. If it contains `x`, the `/etc/shadow` file is used for the password.
* **Group ID (GID)**: The numeric Group ID (GID) which is actually used internally by the system.
* **User List**: a comma separated list of the usernames that are members of this group.

By executing the `id` command a user can also see to which groups his/her account belongs.

For example `id` may output:

::: output
<pre>
uid=1000(bioboost) gid=1000(bioboost) groups=1000(bioboost),4(adm),
24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),108(lpadmin),110(sambashare)
</pre>
:::

To checkout which groups another user belongs too, one can add the username as an argument after the `id` command. For example `id mark`.

## Adding a User

Adding users to the system can be achieved using the command line tools `adduser` followed by the username for the new user. The tool will then present a step by step wizard to set the new user information.

As an example, for adding a new user `mark` to the system one would issue the following command using:

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo adduser mark
```

::: output
<pre>
[sudo] password for bioboost:
Adding user `mark' ...
Adding new group `mark' (1001) ...
Adding new user `mark' (1001) with group `mark' ...
Creating home directory `/home/mark' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for mark
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []: Mark Demeester
	Room Number []:
	Work Phone []:
	Home Phone []:
	Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y
</pre>
:::

From this point on `mark` can log in to the system. Creating a new user using this approach will automatically also create a new group with the same name as the user and make it primary group for that user. A new home directory in `/home` is also automatically created for the user.

Since adding users is a dangerous and administrative task, a normal user is not allowed to do this. It would be a major security hole. For that reason, the command needs to be prefixed with `sudo`.

::: tip Switching Users
To switch to another user account, use the `su` command, for example `su mark`. However if not logged in as root, one will need to provide the password of the user account that is being switched to. When logged in as root, or when prefixing the `su` command with `sudo`, the switch can be made without having to enter the user account password. Example: `sudo su mark`
:::

You may also come across tutorials that use the `useradd` command for creating new users. Basically `useradd` is the native binary compiled with the system. `adduser` is a perl script which uses `useradd` binary in the back-end. `adduser` is more user friendly and interactive than its back-end `useradd`. There's no real difference in features provided.

If one were to execute the `useradd` command with just the username as an argument it would just create a new user with the default shell set to `/bin/sh`. No home directory would be created with the basic provided skeleton files (pre-created files and directories for a new user). Also the user account is created without a password, effectively disabling it until a password has been set using passwd`.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo useradd dennis
```

However, the command options allow us to achieve the same result as `adduser` would:

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo useradd john -m -c "John Rambo,,," -s "/bin/bash"
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo passwd john
```

All changes can be viewed by checking out the `/etc/passwd` file using `cat`:

::: output
<pre>
bioboost:x:1000:1000:BioBoost,,,:/home/bioboost:/usr/bin/zsh
mark:x:1001:1001:Mark Demeester,,,:/home/mark:/bin/bash
dennis:x:1001:1001::/home/dennis:/bin/sh
john:x:1002:1002:John Rambo:/home/john:/bin/bash
</pre>
:::

Do note that the home directory of `dennis` is configured as `/home/dennis`, however if you were to check you would notice that the actual directory does not exist.

## Adding a group

A new group can be created using the `addgroup` command followed by the name of the group.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo addgroup students
```

::: output
<pre>
Adding group `students' (GID 1003) ...
Done.
</pre>
:::

This will create an empty group (without users) called `students`.

## Adding a User to a Group

Adding a user to an existing group (secondary group), can be achieve using the `adduser` command where the first argument is the name of the user and the second argument is the name of the group.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo adduser dennis students
```

::: output
<pre>
Adding user `dennis' to group `students' ...
Adding user dennis to group students
Done.
</pre>
:::

Another option is to use the user modification tool `usermod`. Let us add `john` to the groups `gamers` and `students`:

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo usermod -aG gamers,students john
```

You can check the result using `cat /etc/group`.

## Changing Passwords

Changing passwords can be achieved using the `passwd` tool. A normal user may only change the password for their own account, while the superuser may change the password for any account.

So to change your own password you can use the `passwd` command without extra arguments.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ passwd
```

::: output
<pre>
Changing password for bioboost.
Current password: 
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
</pre>
:::

The superuser can change any account password by specifying the user as an argument. Note that the superuser does not have to know the original password to be able to change it:

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo passwd johhny
```

::: output
<pre>
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
</pre>
:::

::: warning
Make sure to specify the name of the account when setting a password of another user using `sudo` powers. If you `sudo passwd`, you are actually changing the password of the root user.
:::

<!-- TODO -->

## Locking a User Account

One can lock the password of a user account using `passwd -l`, however this does not disable the account. The user may still be able to login using another authentication token (like for example with an SSH key). To disable the account, administrators should use `usermod --expiredate 1`, effectively setting the account's expire date to Jan 2, 1970.

So for example to lock the account of `john`:

```bash
passwd -l john
usermod --expiredate 1 john
```

Note, that this will not even allow root to change to the user `john`.

## Removing a User

To remove a user from the system, one can use the `deluser` command followed by the username of that user.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo deluser mark
```

By default, `deluser` will remove the user without removing the home directory, the mail spool or any other files on the system owned by the user. Removing the home directory and mail spool can be achieved using the `--remove-home` option.

```bash
[bioboost@linux][~]$ sudo deluser --remove-home mark
```

## Removing a Group

To remove a group from the system, one can use the `delgroup` command followed by the name of the group. If the option `--only-if-empty` is given, the group won't be removed if it has any members left. 

::: warning Primary Group
The primary group of an existing user cannot be removed.
:::

## Adding User to Sudoers

The simplest option is to add the user to the `sudo` group specified in the sudoers file. By default, on Debian based distributions like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, members of the `sudo` group are granted with sudo access.

```bash
usermod -aG sudo <user>
```

::: tip admin vs sudo group
Administrators are added to the `sudo` group, but the `admin` group is supported for backward compatibility. From the release notes:

> Up until Ubuntu 11.10, administrator access using the `sudo` tool was granted via the `admin` Unix group. In Ubuntu 12.04, administrator access will be granted via the `sudo` group. This makes Ubuntu more consistent with the upstream implementation and Debian. For compatibility purposes, the `admin` group will continue to provide sudo/administrator access in 12.04.

## Challenges

Try to solve the challenges without using google. Better to use the man-pages to find the information you need.

Mark challenges using a ✅ once they are finished.

### ❌ System user accounts

*Try to login to the `daemon` system user account. Use `sudo su daemon`. What does it display as a message ? What application is outputting this message ? Run that application and prove it.*

### ❌ Creating group with id

*Create a group called `hackers` with the specific group id `1337`. Now create two users (students from the class) and add them both the group.*

### ❌ Difference false and nologin

*Some user entries are showing `/bin/false` as the shell command. Do some research and explain what the difference is with `/usr/sbin/nologin`.*

### ❌ The auth.log file 

*What does the file `/log/var/auth.log` track? Provide an example of a command that shows entries being added to the log after you executed the command. Include the entry here that was added to the file.*

### ❌ Locking out Steve

*Create a new user steve and set a password for the user. Login to the `steve` account using `su` to make sure it works.*

*Now lock the user account and make sure there is no way anyone can login as `steve`, not even `root`*

### ❌ Zsh Shell

*Install the zsh shell on your system. Now change your own shell to `zsh`. Make sure to do this in such a way that a new session will also use `zsh`.*

### ❌ Semester Account

*Create a new account for an exchange student called `maggie`. Make sure the account can only be used until 31st of January of the next year. Basically only for this semester*.
